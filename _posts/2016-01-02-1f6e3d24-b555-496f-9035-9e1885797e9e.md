**Road Tripping Ireland**

Discovering World Heritage on The Island of Ireland

An unforgettable road trip of 8 days. We traveled around visiting the 3 UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Island of Ireland:

1/ Newgrange: a unique ancient tomb, built by a sophisticated civilization lined up with the stars, older than the pyramids.

2/ Giants' Causeway: spectacular rock formations that were created when once the lava hit the sea. Here we discovered the myth of the Giants still lives on.

3/ Skellig Michael; last but not least the mystical island of Skellig Michael, where monks in medieval times thought to build a monastery close to the end of the world, an extremely unique, almost extra terrestrial site, now used as an outer world decor for the new Star Wars.
